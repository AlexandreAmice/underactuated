<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 13"><h1>Robust and
  Stochastic Control</h1>

  <p>My goal of presenting a relatively consumable survey of a few of the main
  ideas is perhaps more important in this chapter than any other.  It's been
  said that "robust control is encrypted" (as in you need to know the secret
  code to get in).  The culture in the robust control community has been to
  leverage high-powered mathematics, sometimes at the cost of offering more
  simple explanations.  This is unfortunate, I think, because robotics and
  machine learning would benefit from a richer connection to these tools, and
  are perhaps destined to reinvent many of them.</p>
    
  <p>The classic reference for robust control is <elib>Zhou97</elib>.
  <elib>Petersen00</elib> has a treatment that does more of it's development in
  the time-domain and via Riccati equations.</p>

  <section><h1>Stochastic models</h1>
  
    <p>So far in the notes, we have concerned ourselves primarily with known,
    deterministic systems.  In the <a href="stochastic.html">stochastic
    systems</a> chapter, we started our study of nonlinear dynamics of
    stochastic systems, which can be beautiful!  In this chapter we will begin
    to consider computational tools for analysis and control of those systems.
    Stochasticity can come in many forms... we may not know the governing
    equations (e.g. the coefficient of friction in the joints), our robot may
    be <a href="https://youtu.be/cNZPRsrwumQ?t=32">walking on unknown terrain,
    subject to unknown disturbances</a>, or even be picking up unknown objects.
    There are a number of mathematical frameworks for considering this
    uncertainty; for our purposes this chapter will generalizing our thinking
    to equations of the form: $$\dot\bx = {\bf f}(\bx, \bu, \bw, t) \qquad
    \text{or} \qquad \bx[n+1] = {\bf f}(\bx[n], \bu[n], \bw[n], n),$$ where
    $\bw$ is a new <i>random</i> input signal to the equations capturing all of
    this potential variability. Although it is certainly possible to work in
    continuous time, and treat $\bw(t)$ as a continuous-time random signal
    (c.f. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener
    process</a>), the notation and intuition is a big simpler when we work with
    $\bw[n]$ as a discrete-time random signal. For this reason, we'll devote
    our attention in this chapter to the discrete-time systems.</p>

    <p>In order to simulate equations of this form, or to design controllers
    against them, we need to define the random process that generates $\bw[n]$.
    It is typical to assume the values $\bw[n]$ are independent and identically
    distributed (i.i.d.), meaning that $\bw[i]$ and $\bw[j]$ are uncorrelated
    when $i \neq j$.  As a result, we typically define our distribution via a
    probability density $p_{\bf w}(\bw[n])$.  This is not as limiting as it may
    sound... if we wish to treat temporally-correlated noise (e.g. "colored
    noise") the format of our equations is rich enough to support this by
    adding additional state variables; we'll give an example below of a
    "whitening filter" for modeling wind gusts.  The other source of randomness
    that we will now consider in the equations is randomness in the initial
    conditions; we will similarly define a probability density
    $p_\bx(\bx[0]).$</p>
      
    <p>This modeling framework is rich enough for us to convey the key ideas;
    but it is not quite sufficient for all of the systems I am interested in.
    In <drake></drake> we go to additional lengths to support more general
    cases of <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__stochastic__systems.html">stochastic
    systems</a>.  This includes modeling system parameters that are drawn from
    random each time the model is initialized, but are fixed over the duration
    of a simulation; it is possible but inefficient to model these as
    additional state variables that have no dynamics.  In other problems, even
    the <i>dimension of the state vector</i> may change in different
    realizations of the problem!  Consider, for instance, the case of a robot
    manipulating random numbers of dishes in a sink. I do not know many control
    formulations that handle this type of randomness well, and I consider this
    a top priority to think more about!  (We'll begin to address it in the <a
    href="output_feedback.html">output feedback chapter</a>.)</p>

  <section><h1>Costs and constraints for stochastic systems</h1>
  
    <p>Given a stochastic model, what sort of cost function should we write in
    order to capture the desired aspect of performance?  There are a number of
    natural choices, which provide nice trade-offs between capturing the
    desired phenomena and computational tractability.</p>

    <todo>Airplane flying through the canyon figure?</todo>

    <p>Remember that $\bx[n]$ is now a random variable, so we want to write our
    cost and constraints using the distribution described e.g. $p_n(\bx)$.
    Broadly speaking, one might specify a cost in a handful of ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Average cost</b>, $E[ \sum_n \ell(\bx[n], \bu[n]) ]$, or some
      averaged/discounted variant.  This is by far the most popular choice
      (especially in reinforcement learning), because it preserves the dynamic
      programming recursion for additive cost.</li>
      <li><b>Worst-case cost</b>, e.g. $\min_{\bu[\cdot]}\max_{\bx[0], {\bf
      w}[\cdot]} \sum_n \ell(\bx[n], \bu[n]).$ When we are able to upper-bound
      this cost and push down on that bound, then this is sometimes call
      <i>guaranteed cost control</i>.</li>
      <li><b>Relative worst-case</b> (aka "gain bounds"). Even for linear
      systems, bounding the absolute performance (for all $\bw$) leads to
      vacuous bounds; we can do much better by evaluating our performance
      metric relative to the magnitude of the disturbance input.</li>
      <li><b>Value at Risk (VaR)</b> and other related metrics from economics
      and operations research. $\text{VaR}(p)$ is the maximum cost if we ignore
      the tails of the distribution (worse outcomes whose combined probability
      is at most $p$). Note that VaR is easy to understand, but the related
      quantity "conditional value at risk" (CVaR) has superior mathematical
      properties, including connections to convex optimization
      <elib>Majumdar20</elib>.</li>
    </ul>
    Similarly, we can think about how to generalize our deterministic
    constraints, e.g. $g(\bx) \le 0,$ into a the stochastic framework:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Chance constraints</b>, which take the form e.g. $\Pr[ g(\bx) \le
      0 ] \le \alpha.$  For instance, we might like to guarantee that the
      probability that our airplane will crash into a tree is less that
      $\alpha$. Even for Gaussian uncertainty and polytopic constraints, these
      quantities can be hard to evaluate exactly; we often end up making
      approximations<elib>Scher22</elib> though there is some hope to provide
      rigorous bounds with Lyapunov-like arguments
      <elib>Steinhardt11a</elib>.</li>
      <li><b>Absolute constraints</b>, which are the worst-case version of the
      chance constraints (take $\alpha = 0$) tend to be much more amenable to
      computation, and connect directly to <a
      href="lyapunov.html#finite-time">reachability analysis</a> (for instance,
      with Lyapunov functions or barrier certificates).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The term "robust control" is typically associated with the class of
    techniques that try to guarantee some <i>worst-case</i> performance or a
    worst-case bound (e.g. the gain bounds). The term "stochastic optimal
    control" or "stochastic control" is typically used as a catch-all for other
    methods that reason about stochasticity, without necessarily providing the
    strict robustness guarantees.</p>
    
    <p>It's important to realize that proponents of robust control are not
    necessarily pessimistic by nature; there is a philosophical stance about
    how difficult it can be to model the true distribution of randomness that a
    control system will face in the world. Worst-case analysis typically
    requires only a definition of the <i>set</i> of possible values that the
    random variable can take, and not a detailed <i>distribution</i> over those
    possible values.  It may be more practical to operationalize a concept like
    "this UAV will not crash so long as the peak wind gusts are below 35 mph"
    than requiring a detailed distribution over wind gust probabilities. But
    this simpler specification does come at some cost -- worst-case
    certificates are often pessimistic about the true performance of a system,
    and optimizing worst-case performance can lead to conservatism in the
    control design.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Analysis</h1>
    
      <subsubsection><h1>Common Lyapunov functions</h1>
        <p>We've already seen one nice example of robustness analysis for
        linear systems when we wrote a small optimization to find a <a
        href="lyapunov.html#common-lyapunov-linear">common Lyapunov function
        for uncertain linear systems</a>.  That example studied the dynamics
        $\bx[n+1] = \bA \bx[n]$ where the coefficients of $\bA$ were unknown
        but bounded.</p>  
      
        <p><a href="lyapunov.html#common-lyapunov">We also saw</a> that
        essentially the same technique can be used to certify stability against
        disturbances, e.g.: $$\bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] + \bw[n], \qquad \bw[n] \in
        \mathcal{W},$$ where $\mathcal{W}$ describes some bounded set of
        possible uncertainties.  In order to be compatible with convex
        optimization, we often choose to describe $\mathcal{W}$ as either an
        ellipsoid or as a convex polytope<elib>Boyd04a</elib>.  But let's
        remember a very important point: in this situation with additive
        disturbances, we can no-longer expect the system to converge stably to
        the origin.  Our example before used the common Lyapunov function only
        to certify the <i>invariance</i> of a region (if I start inside some region, then I'll never leave).</p>

      </subsubsection>
 
      <subsubsection><h1>$L_2$ gain</h1>

        <p>In some sense, the common-Lyapunov analysis above is probably the
        wrong analysis for linear systems (perhaps other systems as well).  It
        might be unreasonable to assume that disturbances are bounded.
        Moreover, we know that the response to an input (including the
        disturbance input) is linear, so we expect the magnitude of the
        deviation in $\bx$ compared to the undisturbed case to be proportional
        to the magnitude of the disturbance, $\bw$.  A more natural bound for a
        linear system's response is to bound the magnitude of the response
        (from zero initial conditions) relative to the magnitude of the
        disturbance.  
        </p>
        
        <!--
        <example><h1>Gain bounds for linear maps</h1>
          <p>Allow me to make the point with a much simpler problem.  Imagine I
          have just a affine function (not even a system): $x = aw$.  One could certainly make the statement: if $|w|\le 1$, then $|x| \le |a|$</p>
        </example>
        -->
        <p>
        Typically, this is done with the a scalar "$L_2$
        gain", $\gamma$, defined as: \begin{align*}\argmin_\gamma \quad
        \subjto& \quad \sup_{\bw(\cdot) \in \int \|\bw(t)\|^2 dt\le \infty}
        \frac{\int_0^T \| \bx(t) \|^2 dt}{\int_0^T \| \bw(t) \|^2dt} \le
        \gamma^2, \qquad \text{or} \\ \argmin_\gamma \quad \subjto&
        \sup_{\bw[\cdot] \in \sum_n \|\bw[n]\|^2 \le \infty} \frac{\sum_0^N
        \|\bx[n]\|^2}{\sum_0^N \| \bw[n] \|^2} \le \gamma^2.\end{align*} The
        name "$L_2$ gain" comes from the use of the $\ell_2$ norm on the
        signals $\bw(t)$ and $\bx(t)$, which is assumed only to be finite.</p>
      
        <p>More often, these gains are written not in terms of $\bx[n]$
        directly, but in terms of some "performance output", $\bz[n]$.  For
        instance, if would would like to bound the cost of a quadratic
        regulator objective as a function of the magnitude of the disturbance,
        we can minimize $$ \min_\gamma \quad \subjto \quad \sup_{\bw[n]}
        \frac{\sum_0^N \|\bz[n]\|^2}{\sum_0^N \| \bw[n] \|^2} \le \gamma^2,
        \qquad \bz[n] = \begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{\bQ} \bx[n] \\ \sqrt{\bR}
        \bu[n]\end{bmatrix}.$$  This is a simple but important idea, and
        understanding it is the key to understanding the language around robust
        control.  In particular the $H_2$ norm of a system (from input $\bw$ to
        output $\bz$) is the energy of the impulse response; when $\bz$ is
        chosen to represent the quadratic regulator cost as above, it
        corresponds to the expected LQR cost.  The $H_\infty$ norm of a system
        (from $\bw$ to $\bz$) is the largest singular value of the transfer
        function; it corresponds to the $L_2$ gain.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Linear Exponential-Quadratic Gaussian (LEQG)</h1>

      <p><elib>Jacobson73</elib> observed that it is also straight-forward to
      minimize the objective: $$J = E\left[ \prod_{n=0}^\infty e^{\bx^T[n] {\bf
      Q} \bx[n]} e^{\bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]} \right] = E\left[
      e^{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \bx^T[n] {\bf Q} \bx[n] + \bu^T[n] {\bf R} \bu[n]}
      \right],$$ with ${\bf Q} = {\bf Q}^T \ge {\bf 0}, {\bf R} = {\bf R}^T >
      0,$ by observing that the cost is monotonically related to $\log{J}$, and
      therefore has the same minima (this same trick forms the basis for
      "geometric programming" <elib>Boyd07</elib>). This is known as the
      "Linear Exponential-Quadratic Gaussian" (LEG or LEQG), and for the
      deterministic version of the problem (no process nor measurement noise)
      the solution is identical to the LQR problem; it adds no new modeling
      power.  But with noise, the LEQG optimal controllers are different from
      the LQG controllers; they depend explicitly on the covariance of the
      noise.  
        
      <todo>introduce the coefficient \sigma here, instead of just throwing it
      in from the start. The coefficient $\sigma$ in the objective is referred
      to as the "risk-sensitivity parameter" <elib>Whittle90</elib>.
      </todo>
      </p>

      <todo>Insert simplest form of the derivation here, plus an example.</todo>

      <p><elib>Whittle90</elib> provides an extensive treatment of this framework;
      nearly all of the analysis from LQR/LQG (including Riccati equations,
      Hamiltonian formulations, etc) have analogs for their versions with
      exponential cost, and he argues that LQG and H-infinity control can
      (should?) be understood as special cases of this approach.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Adaptive control</h1>

      <p>The standard criticism of $H_2$ optimal control is that minimizing the
      expected value does not allow any guarantees on performance.  The
      standard criticism of $H_\infty$ optimal control is that it concerns
      itself with the worst case, and may therefore be conservative, especially
      because distributions over possible disturbances chosen a priori may be
      unnecessarily conservative.  One might hope that we could get some of
      this performance back if we are able to update our models of uncertainty
      online, adapting to the statistics of the disturbances we actually
      receive.  This is one of the goals of adaptive control.</p> 

      <p>One of the fundamental problems in online adaptive control is the
      trade-off between exploration and exploitation.  Some inputs might drive
      the system to build more accurate models of the dynamics / uncertainty
      quickly, which could lead to better performance.  But how can we
      formalize this trade-off?
      </p>

      <p>There has been some nice progress on this challenge in machine
      learning in the setting of (contextual) <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed
      bandit</a>  problems.  For our purposes, you can think of bandits as a
      limiting case of an optimal control problem where there are no dynamics
      (the effects of one control action do not effect the results of the next
      control action).  In this simpler setting, the online optimization
      community has developed exploration-exploitation strategies based on the
      notion of minimizing <i>regret</i> -- typically the accumulated
      difference in the performance achieved by my online algorithm vs the
      performance that would have been achieved if I had been privy to the data
      from my experiments before I started.  This has led to methods that make
      use of concepts like upper-confidence bound (UCB) and more recently
      bounds using a least-squares squares confidence bound
      <elib>Foster20</elib> to provide bounds on the regret.</p>

      <p>In the last few years, we've see these results translated into the setting of linear optimal control... </p>
